Compared with the machine learning or deep learning methods that depend on the pre-defined model and the training dataset for solving SR problems, GP is more focused on finding the solution in a search space. Although GP has good performance on large-scale benchmarks, it randomly transforms individuals to search results without taking advantage of the characteristics of the dataset.<br>So, the search process of GP is usually slow, and the final results could be unstable.<br>To guide GP by these characteristics, we propose a new method for SR, called Taylor genetic programming (TaylorGP). TaylorGP leverages a Taylor polynomial to approximate the symbolic equation that fits the dataset. It also utilizes the Taylor polynomial to extract the features of the symbolic equation: low order polynomial discrimination, variable separability, boundary, monotonic, and parity. GP is enhanced by these Taylor polynomial techniques. Experiments are conducted on three kinds of benchmarks: classical SR, machine learning, and physics. The experimental results show that TaylorGP not only has higher accuracy than the nine baseline methods, but also is faster in finding stable results.</p><h2 id="More-info-about-thie-paper"><a href="#More-info-about-thie-paper" class="headerlink" title="More info about thie paper"></a>More info about thie paper</h2><p>Please see <a href="https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2016/1021378.pdf">Link</a></p><h2 id="Code-Link"><a href="#Code-Link" class="headerlink" title="Code Link"></a>Code Link</h2><p>Please see <a href="https://github.com/KGAE-CUP">Code</a> on our GitHub.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Qiang Lu · Rencai Wang · Bin Yang · Zhiguang Wang.</p><p>Received:  23 September 2018 / 30 June 2019</p><h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>With continued development of location-based systems, large amounts of trajectories become<br>available which record moving objects’ locations across time. If the trajectories collected by<br>different location-based systems come from the same moving object, they are spliceable<br>trajectories, which contribute to representing holistic behaviors of the moving object. In this<br>paper, we consider how to efficiently identify spliceable trajectories. More specifically, we<br>first formalize a spliced model to capture spliceable trajectories where their times are disjoint,<br>and the distances between them are close. Next, to efficiently implement the model, we design<br>three components: a disjoint time index, a directed acyclic graph of sub-trajectory location<br>connections, and two splice algorithms. The disjoint time index saves a disjoint time set of<br>each trajectory for querying disjoint time trajectories efficiently. The directed acyclic graph<br>contributes to discovering groups of spliceable trajectories. Based on the identified groups,<br>the splice algorithm findmaxCTR finds maximal groups containing all spliceable trajectories.<br>Although the splice algorithm is efficient in some practical applications, its running time is<br>exponential. Therefore, an approximate algorithm findApproxMaxCTR is proposed to find<br>trajectories which can be spliced with each other with a certain probability within polynomial<br>run time. Finally, experiments on two datasets demonstrate that the model and its components<br>are effective and efficient.</p><h2 id="More-info-about-thie-paper"><a href="#More-info-about-thie-paper" class="headerlink" title="More info about thie paper"></a>More info about thie paper</h2><p>Please see <a href="https://www.cup.edu.cn/cise/docs/2021-04/99681f7bd5cc4f168be06704098772e4.pdf">KAIS-Link</a></p><h2 id="Code-Link"><a href="#Code-Link" class="headerlink" title="Code Link"></a>Code Link</h2><p>Please see <a href="https://github.com/KGAE-CUP">Code</a> on our GitHub.</p>]]></content>

For implementing SKSS, at first, the knowledge in the process of software development is analyzed. Then, the SKSS is formalized based on the above analysis, and SKSS ontology is created.

In recent years, the CSP is researched by applying evolutionary approaches which includes Genetic Algorithm, Evolutionary Programming, et al. In the paper, an ant colony optimiation (ACO) algorithm for one-dimensional cutting stock problems with muliple stock lengths(MCSP) is presented, and mutation operatation is imported into the ACO in order to avoid the phenomenon of precocity and stagnation emerging. Based on the analysis of the algorithm, the ACO for MCSP has the same time complexity as CSP.

But the results he finds may be biased and restricted to his research field due to limitation of his knowledge. In contrast, Genetic Programming method can discover fitted mathematical expressions from the huge search space through running evolutionary algorithms. And its results can be generalized to accommodate different fields of knowledge. However, since GP has to search a huge space, its speed of finding the results is rather slow. Therefore, in this paper, a framework of connection between Prior Formula Knowledge and GP (PFK-GP) is proposed to reduce the space of GP searching. The PFK is built based on the Deep Belief Network (DBN) which can identify candidate formulas that are consistent with the features of experimental data. By using these candidate formulas as the seed of a randomly generated population, PFK-GP finds the right formulas quickly by exploring the search space of data features. We have compared PFK-GP with Pareto GP on regression of eight benchmark problems. The experimental results confirm that the PFK-GP can reduce the search space and obtain the significant improvement in the quality of SR.</p><h2 id="More-info-about-thie-paper"><a href="#More-info-about-thie-paper" class="headerlink" title="More info about thie paper"></a>More info about thie paper</h2><p>Please see <a href="https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2016/1021378.pdf">Link</a></p><h2 id="Code-Link"><a href="#Code-Link" class="headerlink" title="Code Link"></a>Code Link</h2><p>Please see <a href="https://github.com/KGAE-CUP">Code</a> on our GitHub.</p>]]></content>

To address the premature conver-gence problem of GEP, we propose a novel algorithm named SPJ-GEP, which can maintainthe GEP population diversity and improve the accuracy of the GEP search by allowing thepopulation to jump efficiently between segmented subspaces. SPJ-GEP first divides thespace of mathematical expressions intoksubspaces that are mutually exclusive. It thencreates a subspace selection method that combines the multi-armed bandit and the-greedy strategy to choose a jump subspace. In this way, the analysis is made on the pop-ulation diversity and the range of the number of subspaces. The analysis results show thatSPJ-GEP does not significantly increase the computational complexity of time and spacethan classical GEP methods. Besides, an evaluation is conducted on a set of standard SRbenchmarks. The evaluation results show that the proposed SPJ-GEP keeps a higher popu-lation diversity and has an enhanced accuracy compared with three baseline GEP methods.</p><h2 id="More-info-about-thie-paper"><a href="#More-info-about-thie-paper" class="headerlink" title="More info about thie paper"></a>More info about thie paper</h2><p>Please see <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025520308276">Sciencedirect-Link</a></p><h2 id="Code-Link"><a href="#Code-Link" class="headerlink" title="Code Link"></a>Code Link</h2><p>Please see <a href="https://github.com/KGAE-CUP">Code</a> on our GitHub.</p>]]></content>

They repeatedly search for the same or similar positions in the symbolic space, and easily fall into premature convergence. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a new symbolic expression search algorithm based on the Monte Carlo tree search named SE-MCTS. It creates a tree to represent the symbolic space and remembers its visiting positions. Moreover, it incorporates two neural networks—Actor and Critic into the upper confidence bound to direct its search based on the given dataset features and decide when to use particle swarm optimization to find fitted constants in a mathematical expression. The experiment results show that SE-MCTS can discover more proper mathematical expressions than canonical genetic programming methods.</p><h2 id="More-info-about-thie-paper"><a href="#More-info-about-thie-paper" class="headerlink" title="More info about thie paper"></a>More info about thie paper</h2><p>Please see <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00521-020-05602-2">Springer-Link</a></p><h2 id="Code-Link"><a href="#Code-Link" class="headerlink" title="Code Link"></a>Code Link</h2><p>Please see <a href="https://github.com/KGAE-CUP/SE-MCTS">SE-MCTS</a> on our GitHub.</p>]]></content>
